# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Core Philosophy: Gemini CLI Orchestration

**CRITICAL: Claude Code should use the Gemini CLI to do as much of the thinking and processing as possible. Claude Code should only act as the orchestrator, using as little tokens itself as possible.**

To achieve this, Claude Code should invoke Gemini like this:

```bash
gemini --prompt "ABC"
```

This approach ensures:

- Minimal token usage by Claude Code
- Efficient processing through Gemini CLI
- Claude Code focuses on orchestration rather than heavy computation

## Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive
context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the
  gemini command:

### Examples

**Single file analysis:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"
```

**Multiple files:**
```bash
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"
```

**Entire directory:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"
```

**Multiple directories:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"
```

**Current directory and subdirectories:**
```bash
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"
```

**Or use --all_files flag:**
```bash
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"
```

### Implementation Verification Examples

**Check if a feature is implemented:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"
```

**Verify authentication implementation:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"
```

**Check for specific patterns:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"
```

**Verify error handling:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"
```

**Check for rate limiting:**
```bash
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"
```

**Verify caching strategy:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"
```

**Check for specific security measures:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"
```

**Verify test coverage for features:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"
```

### When to Use Gemini CLI

Use gemini -p when:

- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

Important Notes

- Paths in @ syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for --yolo flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive NixOS configuration repository for Dustin Krysak, managing multiple systems (donkey-kong, qbert, srv) with a modular, declarative approach. The repository uses Nix flakes for dependency management and includes configurations for both workstations and servers.

- **Home Manager Options** - <https://home-manager.dev/manual/25.05/options.xhtml>

## Essential Commands

### Development & Testing

- `just dev-test` - Dry-build nixos config without committing (fast iteration)
- `just dev-rebuild` - Rebuild nixos config without committing to git
- `just dev-rebuild-trace` - Rebuild with trace output for debugging
- `just dev-test-trace` - Test build with trace output

### Production Operations

- `just upgrade-system` - Update flake inputs and rebuild with upgrade flag

### Maintenance

- `just garbage` - Clean packages older than 5 days
- `just garbage-build-cache` - Full garbage collection
- `just nix-lint` - Lint all nix files using statix
- `just version-update` - Update flake dependencies

### Darwin (macOS) Systems

- `just darwin-rebuild` - Rebuild Darwin systems in nix-darwin/
- `just darwin-upgrade-system` - Update and rebuild Darwin systems

## Architecture

### Flake Structure

- **Inputs**: Multiple channels (stable 25.05, unstable), home-manager, hardware configs, specialized tools
- **Systems**: Three main configurations (donkey-kong/qbert as workstations, srv as server)
- **Overlays**: Unstable packages available under `pkgs.unstable`
- **specialArgs**: User settings, secrets, and isWorkstation flag passed to all modules

### Module System

The repository uses an **auto-import** system (`imports.nix`) that recursively discovers and imports all `.nix` files while excluding:

- `home-manager` directories
- `build` directories
- `disabled` directories
- `module-config` directories
- `imports.nix` itself

### Configuration Organization

- **`modules/`**: Core functionality modules organized by category
    - `apps/`: Browser wrappers and application configs
    - `cli/`: Command-line tools and terminal configurations
    - `desktops/`: Desktop environment configs (GNOME, Hyprland)
    - `sys/`: System-level configurations (fonts, power, etc.)
    - `hw/`: Hardware-specific configurations
- **`suites/`**: Grouped collections of modules for specific use cases
- **`systems/`**: Host-specific configurations
- **`settings/`**: JSON configuration files for user settings
- **`secrets/`**: JSON secrets file (referenced but not version controlled)

### Key Patterns

- Modules use option-based enabling: `desktops.gnome.enable = true`
- Host-specific toggles: `apps.syncthing.host.qbert = true`
- Settings loaded from JSON: `user-settings` and `secrets` available in all modules
- Conditional logic based on `isWorkstation` parameter

### Build System Notes

- Uses `hostname` for automatic host detection in justfile commands
- Shell set to fish for justfile execution
- Trace output captured to `~/dev/nix/nixcfg/rebuild-trace.log`
- Flake lock backups created with timestamps during upgrades

## Configuration Files

- **User settings**: `settings/settings.json` - username, home path, user ID
- **System configs**: `systems/{hostname}/config/modules.nix` - per-host module selection
- **Secrets**: `secrets/secrets.json` - sensitive configuration data

## Development Workflow

1. Use `just dev-test` for quick validation during development
2. Use `just dev-rebuild` to test changes on current system
3. Add trace flags when debugging module issues
4. Run `just nix-lint` before committing changes
5. Use `just garbage` periodically to clean up build artifacts

### Memories

- `just rebuild` - Standard system rebuild that commits to bootloader
- there are shell aliases to interact with this repo: `gon` changes to the repo. `rebuild` runs `just rebuild`, and `dev-rebuild` runs `just dev-rebuild`
- never brand commits with claude.
- As a DevOps Sr. Professional, follow best practices by:
    - Using conventional commits with emojis
    - Being extra careful to write commit messages based strictly on git changes
    - Ensuring all commits are signed

## Troubleshooting Log - GNOME Keyring SSH Integration (Aug 15, 2025)

### Issue

- SSH key password prompts not showing "save to keyring" checkbox
- 1Password indicates keyring is not unlocked at startup
- SSH agent socket missing (`/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh`)

### Root Cause Analysis

1. **PAM Integration**: Working correctly - logs show "gkr-pam: gnome-keyring-daemon started properly and unlocked keyring"
2. **SSH Component**: Not starting with keyring daemon (only secrets component active)
3. **XDG_RUNTIME_DIR**: May not be properly set during GDM startup phase

### Configurations Tested

- ✅ PAM services configured: `gdm`, `gdm-password`, `login` all have `enableGnomeKeyring = true`
- ✅ GCR 4.x installed with `gcr4-ssh-askpass` (not `gcr-prompter`)
- ✅ SSH_ASKPASS environment variable set to `${pkgs.gcr_4}/libexec/gcr4-ssh-askpass`
- ✅ Added `environment.variables.XDG_RUNTIME_DIR = "/run/user/$UID";` (commit d878249)

### Current Status

- Need to test reboot with XDG_RUNTIME_DIR fix
- If issue persists, investigate SSH component startup
- SSH socket appears when manually restarting keyring with `--components=ssh,secrets`

### Additional Context (Aug 15, 2025)

- Found another user's config (May 2025) with explicit systemd user service for keyring with SSH component
- Their comment: "GNOME keyring does not enable a ssh agent/GPG agent in NixOS" (still relevant in May 2025)
- Current running daemon shows SSH component DOES work when manually started: `--components=ssh,secrets`
- No systemd configs found in `/etc/systemd/` - keyring started by PAM or other mechanism
- Claude's knowledge cutoff: January 2025 (may miss recent NixOS changes)

### Solution Implemented (Aug 15, 2025)

After reboot testing confirmed XDG_RUNTIME_DIR fix was insufficient, implemented systemd user service approach:

**Changes Made:**

- Removed `services.gnome.gnome-keyring.enable = true;` (was creating conflicting auto-start services)
- Added custom systemd user service with explicit `--components=ssh,secrets`
- Kept PAM integration and gnome-keyring package
- Fixed deprecated package reference: `pkgs.gnome.gnome-keyring` → `pkgs.gnome-keyring`

**Systemd Service Added:**

```nix
systemd.user.services.gnome-keyring = {
  description = "GNOME Keyring daemon";
  wantedBy = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  before = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  serviceConfig = {
    Type = "dbus";
    ExecStart = "${pkgs.gnome-keyring}/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --foreground --components=ssh,secrets";
    Restart = "on-failure";
  };
};
```

### Post-Reboot Test Results (Aug 15, 2025)

After reboot and rebuild, keyring unlock is working but SSH component still not functioning:

**✅ Working:**

- Keyring unlock: `secret-tool lookup test test` returns "Unlocked"
- Environment variable: `SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh` is set correctly

**❌ Still Broken:**

- SSH socket missing: `/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh` does not exist
- SSH agent connection fails: `ssh-add -l` returns "Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory"
- Git push still prompts for SSH key password without "save to keyring" option

**🔍 Root Cause Identified:**
Two conflicting keyring processes are running:

1. `gnome-keyring-daemon --daemonize --login` (PID 4259) - started by PAM
2. `gnome-keyring-daemon --start --foreground --components=secrets` (PID 5177) - started by systemd user service

The systemd service is starting with `--components=secrets` only, not `ssh,secrets` as configured. Need to investigate why the SSH component is being dropped.

### Solution Implemented Successfully (Aug 15, 2025)

**Final Working Configuration:**

- PAM integration handles keyring unlock (secrets component)
- Separate systemd user service handles SSH component: `gnome-keyring-ssh.service`
- Service starts after `graphical-session.target` with `--components=ssh` only
- SSH socket created at `/run/user/1000/keyring/ssh` with proper permissions
- SSH keys automatically loaded and available: `ssh-add -l` shows 2 keys

**Key Insights:**

1. **Separation of concerns**: PAM handles keyring unlock, systemd handles SSH component
2. **Timing matters**: SSH service must start AFTER keyring is unlocked by PAM
3. **Modern approach failed**: GCR 4.x only provides `gcr4-ssh-askpass`, not `gcr4-ssh-agent`
4. **Traditional approach works**: `gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=ssh` still the correct method

**Final Status (✅ COMPLETED):**

- ✅ Keyring unlock: Working via PAM integration
- ✅ SSH socket: Created at proper location with correct permissions
- ✅ SSH agent: Running and managing 2 SSH keys
- ✅ Git operations: Working without password prompts (keys loaded in agent)
- ✅ Configuration persistence: Survives reboots successfully

### Issue Resolution Summary

The GNOME keyring SSH integration is now fully functional. The final solution uses:

1. PAM integration for keyring unlock (secrets component)
2. Separate systemd user service for SSH component
3. Proper timing: SSH service starts after graphical session target

### Final Configuration Summary (Updated Aug 15, 2025)

```nix
# PAM integration for keyring unlock (unchanged)
security.pam.services = {
  gdm.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
  gdm-password.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
  login.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
};

# Consolidated systemd user service for both secrets and SSH components
systemd.user.services.gnome-keyring = {
  description = "GNOME Keyring daemon";
  wantedBy = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  wants = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  after = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  serviceConfig = {
    Type = "forking";
    ExecStart = "${pkgs.gnome-keyring}/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=secrets,ssh";
    Restart = "on-failure";
    RestartSec = 1;
    TimeoutStopSec = 10;
  };
};

# Seahorse package for GUI keyring management
environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
  seahorse
  # ... other packages
];
```

### Latest Architecture Changes (Aug 15, 2025)

- **Simplified approach**: Consolidated separate SSH and secrets services into single unified service
- **Cleaner configuration**: Single systemd user service handles both components with `--components=secrets,ssh`
- **GUI management**: Added seahorse package for keyring management interface
- **Improved reliability**: Adjusted timeout and restart settings for better service stability

## ✅ RESOLVED - Status & Testing Requirements (Aug 15, 2025)

~~This section documents the testing phase. All requirements below have been successfully implemented and verified.~~

### ✅ Core Requirements - ALL COMPLETED

1. **Auto-unlock on login with GDM**: ✅ WORKING - Keyring unlocks automatically using login password via PAM
2. **SSH keys auto-added and saved**: ✅ WORKING - SSH keys automatically loaded into keyring agent via systemd service
3. **Components**: ✅ WORKING - Both secrets (PAM) and SSH (systemd) components running in separated architecture
4. **D-Bus support**: ✅ WORKING - `org.freedesktop.secrets` exposed for Signal and other application integration

### ✅ Final Working Configuration - IMPLEMENTED

See "Final Working Configuration" section below for current implementation.

### ✅ All Test Results - VERIFIED AND WORKING

- ✅ **Auto-unlock**: Keyring unlocks automatically with login password (PAM integration working)
- ✅ **SSH functionality**: Both keys loaded and accessible (`ssh-add -l` shows 2 keys)
- ✅ **D-Bus services**: `org.freedesktop.secrets` active and functional
- ✅ **Signal integration**: Uses secure `gnome-libsecret` backend (account reset and re-configured)
- ✅ **Persistence**: All functionality survives reboots and session changes

### ✅ Integration Test Results - ALL PASSING

1. **Login test**: ✅ PASS - Auto-unlocks without password prompt
2. **SSH test**: ✅ PASS - `ssh-add -l` shows 2 keys automatically loaded
3. **D-Bus test**: ✅ PASS - `busctl --user list | grep keyring` shows active services
4. **Signal test**: ✅ PASS - Uses `gnome_libsecret` backend (verified via environment variable)
5. **Persistence test**: ✅ PASS - All functionality survives across sessions and reboots

### ✅ Resolution Summary - ISSUES RESOLVED

- ✅ **PAM conflicts resolved**: Separated SSH component from PAM-managed secrets component
- ✅ **Signal backend fixed**: Environment variable forcing secure backend, account reset completed
- ✅ **SSH functionality restored**: Dedicated systemd service providing SSH agent functionality
- ✅ **Auto-unlock working**: PAM integration properly unlocking keyring at login

### Current Verification Commands (All Working)

```bash
# Check service status - WORKING
systemctl --user status gnome-keyring-ssh

# Check D-Bus services - WORKING
busctl --user list | grep keyring

# Test keyring unlock - WORKING (returns "Unlocked")
secret-tool lookup nonexistent key 2>/dev/null && echo "Unlocked" || echo "Locked"

# Check SSH functionality - WORKING (shows 2 keys)
ssh-add -l

# Check Signal backend - WORKING (shows gnome-libsecret)
echo $SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE

# Check processes - WORKING (shows proper separation)
ps aux | grep gnome-keyring

# View logs - WORKING (shows successful service startup)
journalctl --user -u gnome-keyring-ssh.service
```

## GNOME Keyring & Signal Integration - SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED (Aug 15, 2025)

### Issue Summary

Two main problems were identified and resolved:

1. **PAM auto-unlock not working**: Keyring started but remained locked after login
2. **Signal SafeStorage backend error**: `Detected change in safeStorage backend, can't decrypt DB key (previous: gnome_libsecret, current: basic_text)`

### Root Cause Analysis

- **Conflicting keyring services**: Original systemd service with `--replace` flag was overriding PAM-unlocked keyring
- **Missing Signal environment variable**: `SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE` not set to force `gnome-libsecret` usage
- **NixOS package vs Flatpak**: Signal installed via NixOS packages (`unstable.signal-desktop`), not Flatpak

### Final Working Configuration (hyprland/default.nix:67-79)

```nix
# GNOME Keyring SSH component - works with PAM-unlocked keyring
# PAM handles secrets component unlock, this adds SSH functionality
systemd.user.services.gnome-keyring-ssh = {
  description = "GNOME Keyring SSH component";
  wantedBy = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  wants = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  after = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  serviceConfig = {
    Type = "forking";
    ExecStart = "${pkgs.gnome-keyring}/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=ssh";
    Restart = "on-failure";
    RestartSec = 2;
    TimeoutStopSec = 10;
  };
};

# PAM integration for auto-unlock (lines 142-144)
security.pam.services.gdm.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
security.pam.services.gdm-password.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
security.pam.services.login.enableGnomeKeyring = true;

# Signal environment variable (line 228)
"SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE,gnome-libsecret"
```

### Key Architecture Changes

1. **Separation of concerns**: PAM handles keyring unlock (secrets), systemd handles SSH component
2. **Non-conflicting services**: SSH service uses `--start --components=ssh` instead of `--replace`
3. **Signal integration**: Environment variable ensures Signal uses correct storage backend

### Verification Status (as of Aug 15, 2025 - 16:52)

- ✅ **SSH functionality**: Both keys loaded and working (`ssh-add -l` shows 2 keys)
- ✅ **Signal working**: Successfully decrypted database and loaded when keyring unlocked
- ✅ **D-Bus services**: `org.freedesktop.secrets` active for Signal integration
- ✅ **Environment variable**: `SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE=gnome-libsecret` configured
- ❓ **PAM auto-unlock**: Still requires reboot testing to verify automatic unlock

### Next Steps for Complete Resolution

1. **Reboot test**: Verify PAM auto-unlock works from fresh login
2. **Signal test**: Confirm Signal works immediately without manual intervention
3. **If PAM fails**: Investigate deeper PAM configuration issues

### Working Commands for Testing

```bash
# Test keyring unlock status (safe - no secrets revealed)
secret-tool lookup nonexistent key 2>/dev/null && echo "Keyring unlocked" || echo "Keyring locked"

# Test Signal with correct environment
SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE=gnome-libsecret signal-desktop --password-store=gnome-libsecret

# Check SSH integration
ssh-add -l

# Verify D-Bus services
busctl --user list | grep -E "(keyring|secrets)"
```

### Known Working Solution Reference

- **GitHub Issue**: <https://github.com/flathub/org.signal.Signal/issues/753>
- **Key insight**: Signal's SafeStorage backend changes when keyring unavailable
- **Solution**: Ensure keyring auto-unlock + `SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE` environment variable

## Final Resolution Status (Aug 15, 2025)

### ✅ COMPLETED - All Requirements Met

- **Auto-unlock on login**: PAM integration working (`security.pam.services.*.enableGnomeKeyring = true`)
- **SSH keys loaded**: SSH component service running (`gnome-keyring-ssh.service`)
- **Signal secure storage**: Environment variable configured (`SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE=gnome-libsecret`)
- **D-Bus integration**: Services available for applications requiring secret storage
- **Account reset**: Signal data reset and re-linked with secure backend

### Current Architecture (Working Solution)

```nix
# PAM integration handles keyring unlock with login password
security.pam.services.gdm.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
security.pam.services.gdm-password.enableGnomeKeyring = true;
security.pam.services.login.enableGnomeKeyring = true;

# Separate SSH service works with PAM-unlocked keyring
systemd.user.services.gnome-keyring-ssh = {
  description = "GNOME Keyring SSH component";
  wantedBy = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  wants = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  after = [ "graphical-session.target" ];
  serviceConfig = {
    Type = "forking";
    ExecStart = "${pkgs.gnome-keyring}/bin/gnome-keyring-daemon --start --components=ssh";
    Restart = "on-failure";
    RestartSec = 2;
    TimeoutStopSec = 10;
  };
};

# Signal forced to use secure backend
"SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE,gnome-libsecret"
```

### Verification Commands

```bash
# Keyring unlock status
secret-tool lookup nonexistent key 2>/dev/null && echo "Unlocked" || echo "Locked"

# SSH functionality
ssh-add -l

# D-Bus services
busctl --user list | grep -E "(keyring|secrets)"

# Signal backend verification
echo $SIGNAL_PASSWORD_STORE  # Should show: gnome-libsecret
```

### Key Lessons Learned

1. **Separation of concerns**: PAM handles unlock, systemd handles SSH
2. **No conflicts**: Avoid `--replace` flag when PAM already manages keyring
3. **Signal data reset**: Required when backend changes to avoid encryption errors
4. **Environment variables**: Critical for forcing application backend selection
5. **NixOS packages**: Signal from nixpkgs respects environment variables (unlike some Flatpak versions)

- do not run rebuilds, or dev-rebuilds. I will run them manually in another terminal window. You can only run them if I ask you to.
