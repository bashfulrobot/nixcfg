## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Perform comprehensive verification that all Darwin/macOS related code has been successfully removed from the NixOS repository. This final verification task ensures no Darwin references remain, the repository builds correctly, and all functionality works as expected on NixOS systems only.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Acceptance Criteria
<!-- AC:BEGIN -->
- [ ] #1 Search entire codebase for remaining "Darwin", "darwin", "isDarwin", and "macOS" references
- [ ] #2 Verify no functional Darwin conditionals remain in any modules
- [ ] #3 Run `just check` successfully without Darwin-related errors
- [ ] #4 Run `just test` successfully to verify dry-build works
- [ ] #5 Confirm all modules load correctly without Darwin dependencies
- [ ] #6 Verify no broken references to removed Darwin files exist
- [ ] #7 Document any intentional Darwin references that should remain (e.g., in comments or documentation)
- [ ] #8 Repository is clean of all functional Darwin/macOS support code
