## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Remove the complete archived nix-darwin directory at `extras/archive/nix-darwin/`. This directory contains legacy macOS configuration including flake.nix, modules, and host configurations that are no longer needed since this repository is now exclusively for NixOS systems. Safe cleanup of legacy code that doesn't affect current functionality.
