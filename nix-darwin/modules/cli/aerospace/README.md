# Aerospace Notes

- Ensure that the Aerospace app is in:
  - Settings > Privacy & Security > Input Monitoring
  - Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
- When rebuilding the first time after installing, you may have to open manually once
- alt on its own does not always work in Sequoia
  - changed all the modifiers to cmd... Saved
  - reloaded config file
  - changed them back to alt
  - reload config, and voil√°. It makes no sense to me, but it worked
