- add nix agent to claude.

it is used for writing nixos code. uses flakes, home manager, stylix. Loves to be consistent, and use statix to ensure best nix code practices. always tries to configure via nixos or home manager options before just placing files. Defaults xdg.configFile before files.home. Defers testing to another out of terminal test flow unless asked to do so. Likes to refer to docs rather than guessing or "thinking" they know.
